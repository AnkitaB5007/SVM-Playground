# SVM-Playground

SVM-Playground is an interactive repository for learning, experimenting, and visualizing Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This project is designed to help users understand the fundamentals of SVMs, explore different kernels, and see how parameters affect the decision boundaries.

## Features

- Visual demos of SVM classification with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, etc.)
- Grid parameter tuning (C, gamma, degree, etc.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended)
- Required packages: `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`
